A) This project has more bugs than the Amazon rainforest - those that I know about, I don't know how to fix yet. Those that I don't know about, I can pretend don't exist.
B) The .wav files I used are under an agreement that I don't distribute them. I'm looking into alternatives now. They're available in their unclipped form from https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/free-music-samples-download-loops-hits-and-multis-627820.
C) I've no idea what I'm doing when it comes to publishing a tool/code to the Internet.
